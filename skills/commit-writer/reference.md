# Commit Message Reference

## Standards and Specifications

### Conventional Commits
- **Website**: https://www.conventionalcommits.org/
- **Specification**: v1.0.0
- **Key Points**:
  - Structured format: `<type>(<scope>): <description>`
  - Types: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, perf, test, build, ci, chore
  - Optional body and footer
  - Breaking changes marked with `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer

### Git Commit Messages Best Practices
- **Subject line**: 50 characters (hard limit 72)
- **Body**: Wrap at 72 characters
- **Imperative mood**: "Add feature" not "Added feature"
- **Separate subject from body**: With blank line
- **Explain what and why**: Not how (code shows how)

## Commit Types Reference

| Type | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| `feat` | New feature for the user | Adding OAuth login |
| `fix` | Bug fix | Fixing null pointer exception |
| `docs` | Documentation changes only | Update README |
| `style` | Code style/formatting changes | Run Prettier |
| `refactor` | Code restructuring, no behavior change | Extract method |
| `perf` | Performance improvements | Add database index |
| `test` | Adding or updating tests | Add unit tests |
| `build` | Build system or dependencies | Update webpack config |
| `ci` | CI/CD changes | Update GitHub Actions |
| `chore` | Maintenance tasks | Update dependencies |
| `revert` | Revert previous commit | Revert "Add feature" |

## Scope Guidelines

Scopes represent the area of the codebase affected:

### Good Scopes
- **Component/Module**: `auth`, `database`, `api`, `ui`
- **Feature Area**: `payments`, `notifications`, `search`
- **Package Name**: `@company/utils`, `core`
- **Subsystem**: `parser`, `compiler`, `renderer`

### Avoid
- **Too Generic**: `code`, `files`, `app`
- **Too Specific**: `UserController.ts`, `line-42`
- **Redundant**: `bugfix`, `update` (these are types, not scopes)

## Footer References

## Repository-Specific Conventions

### Emoji Commits (if repo uses them)
Some projects use emojis as visual commit type indicators:
- ‚ú® `:sparkles:` - New feature
- üêõ `:bug:` - Bug fix
- üìù `:memo:` - Documentation
- ‚ôªÔ∏è `:recycle:` - Refactoring
- ‚ö°Ô∏è `:zap:` - Performance
- ‚úÖ `:white_check_mark:` - Tests
- üîß `:wrench:` - Configuration

**Important**: Only use if the repository already uses this convention.

### Angular Commit Convention
Some projects follow Angular's strict convention:
- Subject must be lowercase
- No period at end
- Specific type list
- Mandatory scope for certain types

**Check repo's CONTRIBUTING.md for specific conventions.**

## Semantic Versioning Connection

Commits drive semantic versioning in automated release systems:
- `fix`: Patch version (0.0.x)
- `feat`: Minor version (0.x.0)
- `BREAKING CHANGE`: Major version (x.0.0)

## Common Anti-Patterns

### 1. Vague Messages
‚ùå "Fix bug"
‚úÖ "fix(auth): resolve token expiration race condition"

### 2. Too Much in One Commit
‚ùå "Add feature X, fix bug Y, update docs, refactor Z"
‚úÖ Split into 4 separate commits

### 3. Implementation Details in Subject
‚ùå "Changed variable name from x to userId"
‚úÖ "refactor(user): improve variable naming clarity"

### 4. Missing Context
‚ùå "Update config"
‚úÖ "build(webpack): enable tree shaking for production builds"

### 5. Personal Notes
‚ùå "Finally got this working!"
‚úÖ "fix(parser): handle edge case with nested brackets"

## Tools and Automation

### Commitlint
Validates commit messages against rules:
```bash
npm install --save-dev @commitlint/cli @commitlint/config-conventional
```

### Conventional Changelog
Generates changelogs from commits:
```bash
npm install --save-dev conventional-changelog-cli
```

### Husky + Commitlint
Enforces conventions with git hooks:
```json
{
  "husky": {
    "hooks": {
      "commit-msg": "commitlint -E HUSKY_GIT_PARAMS"
    }
  }
}
```

## Quick Decision Tree

```
Is this a new feature? ‚Üí feat
Is this fixing a bug? ‚Üí fix
Is this only docs? ‚Üí docs
Is this refactoring with no behavior change? ‚Üí refactor
Is this a performance improvement? ‚Üí perf
Is this only test changes? ‚Üí test
Is this build/tooling? ‚Üí build or ci
Is this dependency update or maintenance? ‚Üí chore
```

## Context Questions to Ask

When analyzing changes, consider:
1. **What** changed? (files, functionality)
2. **Why** did it change? (motivation, issue reference)
3. **How** does it impact users? (breaking change?)
4. **What** should reviewers focus on? (body content)
5. **What** testing was done? (confidence level)

Remember: A commit message is a letter to your future self and teammates.
